# ToDo.js
Implementation of a To Do list app. You can set a priority level and a date to the task.
When the task is created it features a button for completing the task and another for deletion of it. 
The form won't allow task creation if it is empty. An update is on the way to show an alert when this happens.
On the bottom left corner ther is an HTML 5 date picker that can be missed since it doesn't show placeholder text. An update is on the way for fixing this.
